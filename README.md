## ❤️ rPPG + TrustScore

SwasthOne uses a short smartphone camera recording to estimate heart rate through facial rPPG signals.

### V2 Pipeline

### rPPG Methods

- POS
- CHROME
- GREEN
- ICA
- LGI
- PBV
- OMIT

TrustScore evaluates signal quality, temporal stability, algorithm agreement, region agreement, motion, and lighting.

> **Note:** rPPG and TrustScore are screening/support features and are not a substitute for clinically validated medical equipment or professional medical advice.

```

The rPPG engine runs as a separate Python service so the tested V2 pipeline remains independent from the Node.js backend.

## ⚙️ Local Setup

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### rPPG Service

```bash
cd rppg_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python service.py
```

Create the required `.env` files using the provided `.env.example` files.

**Never commit `.env` files or credentials.**

## ☁️ Deployment

The application is designed for separate deployment of:

- React frontend
- Node.js backend
- Python rPPG service
- MongoDB Atlas

SwasthOne is a hackathon prototype for healthcare screening and workflow support. rPPG measurements may be affected by motion, lighting, camera quality, and other factors. Clinical decisions should be made by qualified healthcare professionals.
